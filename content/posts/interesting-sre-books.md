## SRE

There are two books that are essential for me to obtain good knowledge about "what's SRE":

- [Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems](https://www.amazon.es/Site-Reliability-Engineering-Betsy-Beyer/dp/149192912X/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=11XYL7A04TS2A&dchild=1&keywords=site+reliability+engineering&qid=1612466889&sprefix=site+re%2Caps%2C178&sr=8-1)
- [The Site Reliability Workbook: Practical Ways to Implement SRE](https://www.amazon.es/Site-Reliability-Workbook-Practical-Implement/dp/1492029505/ref=sr_1_2?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=11XYL7A04TS2A&dchild=1&keywords=site+reliability+engineering&qid=1612466889&sprefix=site+re%2Caps%2C178&sr=8-2)

## Systems

You need to know how systems work to become a good SRE. Having a good knowledge of hoy CPU, RAM, disks and networking works will help you to solve incidents and create strong systems.

- [Systems Performance](https://www.amazon.es/Systems-Performance-Brendan-Gregg/dp/0136820158/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=systems+performance&qid=1612467176&sr=8-1)

## Microservices

Monoliths are dying and you have to know about distributed systems and microservices.

- [Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems](https://www.amazon.es/Building-Microservices-Designing-Fine-Grained-Systems/dp/1492034029/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=building+microservices&qid=1612467298&sr=8-3)

## Containers

Not all companies work with containers as Serverless computing is becoming more popular day by day, but it's important that you know about containers and Kubernetes.

- [Docker: Up & Running: Shipping Reliable Containers in Production](https://www.amazon.es/Docker-Shipping-Reliable-Containers-Production/dp/1492036730/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=docker+containers&qid=1612468642&sr=8-3)
- [Kubernetes: Up and Running: Up and Running](https://www.amazon.es/Kubernetes-Running-Dive-Future-Infrastructure/dp/1492046531/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=kubernetes&qid=1612468670&sr=8-3)

## Programming

You aren't a developer, keep that in mind, but at least it's necessary that you know how to program in at least one language (apart from Bash and Powershell.) I recommend to learn Python due to a simple reason: it's easy to learn and start doing things with it.

- [Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages](https://www.amazon.es/Introducing-Python-Modern-Computing-Packages/dp/1492051365/ref=sr_1_7?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=python+oreilly&qid=1612467771&sr=8-7)
- [Python for DevOps: Learn Ruthlessly Effective Automation](https://www.amazon.es/Python-DevOps-Ruthlessly-Effective-Automation/dp/149205769X/ref=sr_1_16?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=python+oreilly&qid=1612467792&sr=8-16)

## Automation

As a SRE you have to automate things. If there's something you can automate, do it, you won't regret it. You will have to use CI/CD, IaC and provisioning tools to be an automation god.

- [Terraform: Up & Running: Writing Infrastructure as Code](https://www.amazon.es/Terraform-Running-Writing-Infrastructure-Code/dp/1492046906/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=3BQA6YMKH8JUM&dchild=1&keywords=terraform+up+%26+running&qid=1612468092&sprefix=terraform+up+%2Caps%2C198&sr=8-1)
- [Mastering Ansible: Effectively automate configuration management and deployment challenges with Ansible 2.7](https://www.amazon.es/Mastering-Ansible-Effectively-configuration-management/dp/1789951542/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=Mastering+Ansible&qid=1612468161&sr=8-1)

## Observability

Oh yes, you will never stop creating new alerts and new dashboards to keep your systems under control.
