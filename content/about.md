Yey! This is Alex, I'm a 23 yo SRE that likes talking about mostly everything, but I will try write just about different technologies, methodologies or anything related to the "SRE" world and... anime. 

Yes, anime.

＼(≧▽≦)／

These are the technologies I like the most, so probably most of my posts will be related to them:

- Terraform
- Kubernetes
- Azure
- Docker
- CI/CD (Azure DevOps, Jenkins...)
- Observability tools

And... this is me!
